# Sum two numbers

You have two non-empty linked lists representing two positive integers. Each of their nodes contain a single digit and the digits are stored in reverse order. Sum the two numbers and return the result as a linked list.

The two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

```java
class Exercise {
    public ListNode sumTwoNumbers(ListNode l1, ListNode l2) {
        
    }
}
```
